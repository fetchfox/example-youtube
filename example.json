Andrej´s lecture is the very best I found to get up to speed on most important details in the least possible time.",

It depends on convexity vs non-convexity in the data space. non-convexity requires a minimum of 2 hidden layers to represent. This is why before you dig into deep learning and all the modern stuff a good basis in Universal Approximation Theory and NN's as Universal Approximators is critical!",
